# What is this codebase?
This is the Sauce Labs Sample Application which is designed to be used from desktop web browsers

## Notes
The new site has been build to run in a subdirectory `https://www.saucedemo.com/new`. You can find more information in 
[this](./new)-folder. You need to go to the folder by running `cd new` and run it from there. The GitHub Workflow will
automatically publish the new site in a sub-directory on `https://www.saucedemo.com/new`.

When we deploy it for the main domain we need to change (based on 
[this](https://medium.com/@svinkle/how-to-deploy-a-react-app-to-a-subdirectory-f694d46427c1)):
- [ ] [`homepage.package.json`](./new/package.json) from `"homepage": "https://www.saucedemo.com/new",` 
to `"homepage": "https://www.saucedemo.com",`
- [ ] Router in the [`index.js`](./new/src/index.jsx)-file by removing the `basename={'/new'}`
- [ ] Change the [`index.html`](./new/public/index.html)-file from

    ```js
    window.history.replaceState(null, null,
            '/new' +
            (q.pathname || '') +
            (q.query || '') +
            l.hash
    );
  
    // TO
    window.history.replaceState(null, null,
            (q.pathname || '') +
            (q.query || '') +
            l.hash
    );
    ```
- [ ] Remove the comment in the [`404.html`](./new/public/404.html)-file when we deploy to the main directory instead of the 
subdirectory
- [ ] Remove the `postbuild`-script and it's files from the [`package.json`](./new/package.json)-file and 
[`scripts`](./scripts)-folder
- [ ] Change the `baseUrl` in the [`wdio.shared.conf.js`](./new/test/e2e/configs/wdio.shared.conf.js)-file from 
`baseUrl: 'http://localhost:3000/new'` to `baseUrl: 'http://localhost:3000'`
- remove the new site references and steps in the [GitHub Workflow](./.github/workflows/github-pages.yml)

## Setup

### Requirements

To set up the development environment directly on your host computer:

1. Youâ€™ll need [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) installed (at least v10.x.x or higher). If you don't have Node installed, we recommend installing [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to assist managing multiple active Node.js versions.
1. Fork the project.
1. Clone the project somewhere on your computer

        git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/sample-app-web.git

1. Install all dependencies

        npm install

### Build
1. Build the application with

        npm run start

    This will build the application, start Chrome and load the website on [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

1. Click around - this is the app!
1. Install [OpenJDK 8](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) for running the end-to-end tests

1. Install [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) for running the end-to-end tests

### Setup issues

If you encounter any issues with this build process, e.g.:

```
$ npm run build
> sample-app-web@1.0.0 build /Users/unlucky-user/sample-app-web
> webpack --mode production

sh: webpack: command not found
```

You have probably hit a dependency conflict issue. To resolve this, do the following in the root of the repository:

1. `npm cache clean --force`
2. `rm -rf node_modules`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run build`

## Test

### Testing locally

To run the application test suite (which uses Webdriver.io, Selenium, and Chrome) make sure the application is running on [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) (see above steps)

1. `npm run test.e2e.local`

This will run the application test suite

### Testing on Saucelabs

Running on Sauce Labs uses Environment Variables to authenticate credentials. You can find a guide on how to do this [here.](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/display/DOCS/Best+Practice%3A+Use+Environment+Variables+for+Authentication+Credentials)

1. `npm run test.e2e.sauce.us` to run tests on the Sauce Labs in the US Data Center
2. `npm run test.e2e.sayce.edu` to run tests in the EU Data Center


## Deploy

Merges to master will automatically deploy to:
* https://www.saucedemo.com
* https://saucelabs.github.io/sample-app-web/
