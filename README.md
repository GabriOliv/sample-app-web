# What is this codebase?
This is the Sauce Labs Sample Application which is designed to be used from desktop web browsers

# Setup

In order to set up this project and start contributing follow this step by step guide:

1. You’ll need [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) installed (at least v10.x.x or higher). If you don't have Node installed, we recommend installing [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to assist managing multiple active Node.js versions.
1. Fork the project. 
1. Clone the project somewhere on your computer
    
        git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/sample-app-web.git

1. Install all dependencies

        npm install

1. Build the application with

        npm run start
    
    This will build the application, start Chrome and load the website on [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
 
1. Click around - this is the app!


# Test

To run the application test suite (which uses Webdriver.io, Selenium, and Chrome) make sure the application is running on [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/), see above steps 

1. `npm test`

This will run the application test suite - screenshots generated by the tests will be placed in _[project-root]_`/screenshots/**/*.png`, and the output will look like:
